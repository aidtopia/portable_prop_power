# Portable Prop Power

A design for powering Halloween props from cordless tool batteries.

Adapter plates are available for rechargeable battery packs for cordless tools from brands like Ridgid, Ryobi, Dewalt, and others. If you already have batteries and chargers, why not use them to power your Halloween props?

This is a work-in-progress.  Details to come.
